Types of analysis
algo analysis -> 3 methods -> substition, recurrance tree and master's theorem
2 types of algo analysis -> posterior and priori
Asymptotic notation -> Big O, Omega and theta + small o and omega(w), upperbound-lowerbound with graphs

paradimes -> greedy algo 
graphs -> adjancy matrix,adjancy list
dictionary representation, BFS, DFS , disjoint set, 
Spanning tree -> (i) kruskal (ii) prims   
problems -> traveling salesman, knapsack, making changes 

codes to be done -> knapsack, making change, DFS, BFS,
