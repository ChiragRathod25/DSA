      <H2>Downloading Models</H2></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the 
      model files at the Large Geometric Models Archive have been compressed 
      using the "gzip" program, and the file names have been appended with the 
      suffix ".gz". You will need the program "gunzip" or a similar tool in 
      order to recover the uncompressed polygon files. 
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Web browsers will allow you to download a 
      polygonal model simply by clicking on the appropriate download link. 
      However, some browsers have the default behavior of uncompressing a file 
      with the ".gz" suffix and then attempting to display the result as an HTML 
      page. If this is the case with your browser, you will need to find another 
      option that will give you a dialog box that allows you to specify a 
      location at which to store the file on disk. For Netscape, holding down 
      the "Shift" key and left clicking on the file link will pop up this dialog 
      box.

      <H2>Polygon Model Formats</H2></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have 
      provided each model in at least two different polygon file formats, 
      Inventor and PLY. We describe each of these below in more detail. 
      <P><B>PLY Files</B> 
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PLY file format is a simple description 
      that was designed as a convenient format for researchers who work with 
      polygonal models. There is both a text and a binary PLY file type, but all 
      of the PLY files at this site are text files. For more information about 
      the PLY file format including code to read, write and manipulate files, 
      visit our <A 
      href="http://www-static.cc.gatech.edu/projects/large_models/ply.html">PLY 
      page.</A> With the code that we have provided, you can probably add a PLY 
      file reader to an existing polygon manipulation program in an hour or 
      less. 
      <P><B>Inventor Files</B> 
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Inventor files at this site are all text 
      files. The polygonal object files that we provide are what is known in 
      Inventor as an Indexed Face Set. This means that each vertex in a model is 
      listed once, and each vertex consists of (x,y,z) coordinates and possibly 
      surface normals. Each polygon is simply a short list of indices into the 
      list of vertices. Because Inventor describes objects as general directed 
      graphs, an Inventor file typically contains several levels of nested 
      keywords, braces and brackets. 
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because it is an open standard, there are many 
      tools that read and display Inventor files. Moreover, the Inventor file 
      format is very closely related to the VRML file format, so an Inventor 
      file may be easily converted to VRML. 
      <P><B>VRML</B> 
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some of the polygon files, we have also 
      provided a small VRML file of the given model. These VRML files do NOT 
      contain the full-sized models. Rather, they are simplified version of the 
      models that will allow you to get a rough idea of the 3D shape of the full 
      models.
